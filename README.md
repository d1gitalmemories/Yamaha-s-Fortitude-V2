# THIS IS A DEMO. NOT A FULL EXACT REPLICA OF THEIR BOT.

This demo only has /pray command, and for demo purposes it's using JSON to store data, but with modifications you can save data to a proper database like SQlite3 or MySQL.
You need a group to use this, as well as knowledge of Roblox APIs.
For verification centre, download it here:

Used Flask, with some Python knowledge, you can use FastAPI as well. You need a hoster for this. I suggest https://bot-hosting.net/ as it's easy to setup a domain and it's cheap.
Replace last line with your open Port. Change API URLs to yours.
